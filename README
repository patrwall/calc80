Calc80 version 0.02 by Patrik Wallander

The purpose of this calculator program is to emulate a simple scientific
calculator. Such as I was referred to use during examinations at the
university. In time, I became accustomed to the order in which operations
are calculated and now prefer it instead of a more advanced calculator.
The program may be distributed under the GPL2 license. I give no assurance 
that this program will not harm your equipment or cause any data loss.

To do, future milestones:
Version 0.1 Clean up code, Windows version, icon, install and configure script, fix eventual bugs, make menu reachable from keyboard
Version 0.2 Fractions, rectangular to polar conversion, engineering mode
Version 0.3 Binary, octal, and hexadecimal modes
Version 0.4 Statistics

Installation:
It needs FLTK 1.3 library to compile. Simply run "make" to build the program.
To install move the file calc80 to /usr/local/bin/.
